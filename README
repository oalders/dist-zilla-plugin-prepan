NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PrePAN - Automatically set PrePAN author and module
    URLs

VERSION
    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
    In "dist.ini":

        [PrePAN]

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin sets a PrePAN.org author and module URL for a distribution.

METHODS
  author
    This is the author URL. You'll need to create an account at PrePAN and
    copy/paste it from there. We can't infer the URL because it's not
    guessable.

        [PrePAN]
        author = http://prepan.org/user/3Yz7PYrBzQ

  module
    This is the module URL. After you've created an account, you'll need to
    post your module description on PrePAN and copy/paste the URL from
    there. We can't infer the URL because it's not guessable.

        [PrePAN]
        module = http://prepan.org/module/429En4oFdp

  metadata
    Sets the author and/or module urls in the distribution's META file(s).
